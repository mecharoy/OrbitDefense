Game Design Document: Chrono-Echo1. Game OverviewTitle: Chrono-Echo: The Time-Loop HeistGenre: 2D Top-Down Stealth PuzzlePlatform: Web Browser (Mobile/Desktop responsive)Tech Stack: HTML5 Canvas, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), CSS3High-Level ConceptA single-player cooperative game where the player must cooperate with past versions of themselves to pull off impossible heists. The player enters a room, performs actions for 15 seconds, and then the timeline resets. On the next loop, the player's previous run replays as a "Time Echo" (ghost). The goal is to synchronize multiple timeline loops to solve puzzles (e.g., holding open three pressure plates simultaneously).2. Gameplay MechanicsThe Loop SystemDuration: Each level has a set loop limit (e.g., 3 loops of 15 seconds each).Recording: During a live run, the game records every input (movement, action key) with a timestamp.Playback: On reset, the game instantiates a "Ghost Entity" that replays the recorded inputs exactly.Paradox Fail State: If a live player blocks the path of a Ghost Entity, causing it to deviate from its recorded path, a "Paradox" occurs, and the level fails immediately.The Heist ElementsGuards: Patrol strictly defined paths. They have vision cones.Mechanic: You can use Loop 1 to distract a guard (e.g., throw a noise-maker), clearing the path for your Loop 2 self to sneak by.Pressure Plates & Switches: Some doors require a button to be held down constantly.Mechanic: Loop 1 stands on the button. Loop 2 walks through the now-open door.Data Uplinks: Require the player to stand still in a zone for 5 seconds to "hack" the terminal.ControlsMovement: WASD / Arrow Keys (Touch joystick for mobile).Action: Spacebar (Interact/Wait).Reset: 'R' key to manually reset the loop early (saving time).3. Technical Architecture PlanCore ModulesGameLoop.js: Manages the requestAnimationFrame cycle. Handles update() (logic) and draw() (rendering) separately to allow for pause/resume functionality.TimeManager.js: The brain of the game.Maintains currentTick.Stores arrays of input data: History = [Run1Data, Run2Data, ...].Handles the "Rewind" visual effect.EntityManager.js:Manages the Player (live) and Ghosts (replaying).Handles collision detection (AABB or Circle) between Player vs. Environment and Player vs. Guards.InputHandler.js: Event listeners for keyboard/touch. crucial: Must normalize inputs so replay is deterministic.Data StructuresInput Frame: { tick: 120, keys: ['UP', 'SPACE'] }Level Data (JSON):{
  "id": 1,
  "layout": [[0,1,0], ...],
  "guards": [{"start": [5,5], "path": [[5,5], [5,10]]}],
  "maxLoops": 3

4. Art & Audio StyleVisuals: Minimalist neon/cyberpunk.Player: Blue neon circle.Ghosts: Faded/glitching cyan circles.Guards: Red triangles with visible vision cone polygons.Audio: Synth-wave backing track. Sound effects must be short and distinct (e.g., clock ticking, alarm buzz).5. Deployment Pipeline (GitHub + Vercel)Version Control: Git repository hosted on GitHub.Hosting: Connect GitHub repo to Vercel.Build Command: None required for Vanilla JS, but if using a bundler (Vite/Webpack), command is npm run build.Output Directory: dist/ or root depending on structure.
