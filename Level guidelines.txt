Chrono-Echo: Level Design & ProgressionThis document outlines the progression for the first 5 levels, introducing mechanics (Loops, Clones, Guards, Paradoxes) step-by-step.Level 1: "The First Echo"Theme: Introduction to Time Loops & Ghosts.Max Loops: 2Time Limit: 10 secondsLayoutA simple straight corridor divided by a locked door in the middle.Zone A (Start): Contains the Player Spawn and a Purple Floor Button.Zone B (End): Contains the Green Goal.Obstacle: The door only stays open while the Purple Button is pressed.ObjectiveReach the Goal in Zone B.SolutionLoop 1: Run to the button and stand on it until the timer runs out.Loop 2: Wait for your "Ghost" (Loop 1) to run to the button. Once the door opens, walk through to the goal.Level 2: "The Relay"Theme: Sequential dependency (Loop 2 depends on Loop 1).Max Loops: 3Time Limit: 15 secondsLayoutA zig-zag corridor with two gates: Gate A and Gate B.Button A is near the start. It opens Gate A.Button B is behind Gate A. It opens Gate B.Goal is behind Gate B.ObjectiveReach the Goal.SolutionLoop 1: Hold Button A. (Opens Gate A).Loop 2: Walk past your ghost, go through Gate A, and hold Button B. (Opens Gate B).Loop 3: Walk past Ghost 1, through Gate A, past Ghost 2, through Gate B to the Goal.Level 3: "Visual Contact"Theme: Introduction to Guards & Distraction.Max Loops: 2Time Limit: 12 secondsLayoutA large square room.Guard: Standing still in the center, looking directly at the Data Uplink (Goal).Mechanic: If the Guard sees you (Vision Cone), the level resets immediately.Environment: A few pillars for cover.ObjectiveHack the Data Uplink (Stand in zone for 3 seconds) without being seen.SolutionLoop 1 (The Decoy): Run out from cover into the Guard's peripheral vision on the left side of the room, drawing their attention/rotation away from the goal. You will get spotted and "fail" this loop (which is fine, as long as the timer doesn't hit 0 before you distract them).Loop 2: While the Guard turns to look at Ghost 1, sneak around the right side (blind spot) and hack the Uplink.Level 4: "Synchronized Heist"Theme: Precise Timing & Multiple Objectives.Max Loops: 3Time Limit: 15 secondsLayoutA fork in the road.Left Path: Contains Switch A.Right Path: Contains Switch B.Middle Path: Contains a heavy Blast Door leading to the Goal.Mechanic: The Blast Door only opens if Switch A and Switch B are active at the exact same moment.ObjectiveOpen the Blast Door and exit.SolutionLoop 1: Run down Left Path. Wait. Hit Switch A at exactly T=10s.Loop 2: Run down Right Path. Wait. Hit Switch B at exactly T=10s.Loop 3: Run down Middle Path. The door will open briefly at T=10s. Dash through.Level 5: "The Paradox Corridor"Theme: Spatial Management (Avoiding your own Ghosts).Max Loops: 3Time Limit: 15 secondsLayoutA very narrow hallway (only 1 player-width wide).Button A is at the far end of the hall. It opens a side door near the start.Problem: The hallway is too narrow to walk past another entity without colliding (causing a Paradox).ObjectiveExit via the side door.SolutionLoop 1: Run down the narrow hall to Button A. Stand there.Crucial: You must hug the back wall of the button alcove.Loop 2: This is the trick. You cannot walk down the hall because Ghost 1 is walking down it.You must wait at the start area (in a nook) for Ghost 1 to pass you.Once Ghost 1 passes, you follow behind them.Ghost 1 hits the button. The side door opens.You turn back? No, not enough time.Correction:Loop 1: Run to Button. Hold it.Loop 2: Wait in Start Nook. Let Ghost 1 pass. Run behind Ghost 1 halfway, then duck into a small side alcove midway down the hall.Loop 3: Wait for Ghost 1 to pass. Wait for Ghost 2 to pass. Ghost 1 opens the door. You (Loop 3) are still at the start. Walk through the open side door.Note: This level teaches players that they occupy physical space and must plan "parking spots" for their past selves.
